# UX and Accessibility

#### Solo project for Epicodus JS Week 4 _2018_

#### by **Adam Smith**

## Pre-planning:

It's easy to know good UX design when you see it, but what makes it good design?

This week's project is to focus on our own development. The act of solving problems is a constant in the life of a developer. Learning new concepts and overcoming obstacles is the only way to grow and become a better developer.

Programming is full of rules about syntax and data flow, but there aren't any direct _rules_ about the way something must be visually designed. This makes it a challenging concept to grasp for a more logical person like myself. _How do you make something look visually appealing? What typefaces are right for my page?_.

Everyone deserves equal access to information, right? Another challenge for a lot of designers is maintaining standards of  _web accessibility_.

Today I'm going to spend my time learning more about UX design basics while trying to maintain web accessibility standards.
