# UX and Accessibility

#### Solo project for Epicodus JS Week 4 _2018_

#### by **Adam Smith**

## Pre-planning:

It's easy to know good UX design when you see it, but what makes it good design?

This week's project is to focus on our own development. The act of solving problems is a constant in the life of a developer. Learning new concepts and overcoming obstacles is the only way to grow and become a better developer.

Programming is full of rules about syntax and data flow, but there aren't any direct _rules_ about the way something must be visually designed. This makes it a challenging concept to grasp for a more logical person like myself. _How do you make something look visually appealing? What typefaces are right for my page?_.

Everyone deserves equal access to information, right? Another challenge for a lot of designers is maintaining standards of  _web accessibility_.

Today I'm going to spend my time learning more about UX design basics while trying to maintain web accessibility standards.

## Post-research

Design suggestions seem pretty straight-forward for the most part. From what I understand, good design principles generally have to do with organization, simplicity, and ease of usability. Of course there is a lot to learn about design that will take more time and research, but I feel like I have a better understanding about some of the foundational ideas behind good design: Aligning things into a grid for visual organization, no more than two fonts used per design, avoiding fancy display type fonts, and reducing clutter by adding more whitespace into designs.

As far as accessibility standards are concerned, a lot of them can be implemented by using HTML the way it was meant to be used. Heading tags on headings, unordered or ordered list tags on list parent elements, list item tags on list items, etc. This is important for screen-readers and text-to-voice devices to know where and what to read. Not using color to convey important information and using high enough contrast (at least 4.5:1 ratio for most text and images of text, 3:1 for large text and images of large text) is necessary for people with low-vision or colorblindness. There is so much to know about web accessibility, it's no wonder why there are designers, engineers, groups, and organizations who specialize in this field. There are browser plugins that can help developers ensure they are meeting accessibility requirements.
